              <h1>Pack Overview</h1>

<p>The Github Student Developer Pack [GSDP] includes plenty of great tools for any young programmer or college student. Hopefully this overview should give you a good idea on how to get started using this pack. There are still a few products that I haven&#39;t figured out yet. Give me some time and hopefully by the time you come back to this post they will be filled out.</p>

<p>I’ll start with the more basic tools first.</p>

<h4>Atom:</h4>

<p>A free, customizable, and versatile text editor that can be used virtually on every OS and for any textfile. This doesn’t seem too spiffy at first if you have a favorite IDE for every language, but where Atom really shines is when you have an awkward file type to work with and the only option you have is to open notepad/notepad++/sublime text. It is an extendable and moddable text editor. I use it to write these markdown-based blog posts and for some of the tutorials on this blog I will be using Atom.</p>

<h4>Namecheap:</h4>

<p>Namecheap is a domain registrar/web hosting company. In the pack they will provide you with two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A one year .me domain registration</li>
<li>A one year SSL certificate.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this domain you are one step closer to owning your own website. You will still need some place to host your site. By default Namecheap will provide two options: you can either host it on Github pages (recommended) or an about.me Premium page. Of course there is one more option and that is to find another hosting provider (such as DigitalOcean or Amazon Web Services).</p>

<h4>HackHands:</h4>

<p>Ever get stuck on a bug in a personal project and there was no one in sight to help? Well whether you are stuck at 2:00pm or 3:00am, HackHands is here to help! In this pack HackHands will grant you $25 in platform credits so you can live access to an expert to help you on your project or <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> homework (but you should probably go meet with your professor instead). Of course if you don’t need the help because you are already an expert programmer you could always sign up as a helper to earn money in your spare time.</p>

<h4>Visual Studio:</h4>

<p>Visual Studio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) created by Microsoft. Out of the box, Visual Studio can be used to create C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, and ASP.NET code. There are many different versions of visual studio and this developer pack will give you access to the already free Community Edition. If your school is listed as a DreamSpark Premium school, then you will be able to access the Professional version of Visual Studio for free. Visual Studio is not the only product you can get through DreamSpark/DreamSpark Premium. To learn more about the DreamSpark program visit their website.</p>

<h4>DigitalOcean:</h4>

<p>Now we start to get to the exciting bits. With Digital Ocean you can get access to your own virtual server in the cloud. With the [GSDP] you get $50 in credits to use however you wish. You can create a game server or a web server or just use it to temporary host a project. You are charged hourly and only when your server is active.</p>

<h4>AWS Educate:</h4>

<p>Amazon Web Services Educate is a student program that attempts to provide students with cloud computers and resources for learning how to use AWS. Some of the learning resources they provide are video lectures and notes from other universities. As a student I found the educational side of AWS to be lacking because there are better videos and resources on how to use AWS that can be found by Google. Also AWS currently doesn’t provide an efficient way to navigate through uploaded tutorials. But the credits for AWS are extremely useful! Not only will you get credits (which can vary in amount depending on the institution), but you should also automatically qualify for AWS Free Tier; which is a program that includes free tier services for 12 months after your sign-up date. More information can be found on AWS website. Like Digital Ocean AWS is charged hourly and can also be used to host servers such as web servers and game servers. But as we will discuss later, Digital Ocean is currently a much better option for running a game server than AWS.</p>

<h4>SendGrid:</h4>

<p>SendGrid is a service that allows you to send emails in bulk. This service is necessary if you need to send confirmation emails for signing up for a service or emails to advertise your product. You will get 15k free emails/month, which should be  enough to get a product of yours started and will certainly be enough if you want to play around with SendGrid. What I really like about this offer is that you keep this service while you are a student so it won’t expire after just a year.</p>

<h4>stripe:</h4>

<p>Stripe is a payment processer that can accept payments from everywhere. If you need a payment processor included in an application than stripe will be the payment processor for you! Stripe’s API can be used with a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, Ruby and more. With the [GSDP], Stripe will waive transaction fees on the first $1,000 of revenue.</p>

<h4>CrowdFlower:</h4>

<p>First I thought that CrowdFlower was going to be a crowd-funding campaign website just because of its name. I was wrong. CrowdFlower is a “data enrichment platform”. It is a place where you can upload a set of data and have it tailored the way you like it. It can be used for transcription, data collection, content moderation and much more.</p>

<h4>Travis Cl:</h4>

<p>Travis CI is a build automation tool that interacts with your GitHub repos. It is free for open source projects, but for private repos there is a fee. In this pack you will get free private builds while you are a student. Travis will do a build every time you push your code and will spot bugs that you may have missed in the process.</p>

<h4>Unreal Engine:</h4>

<p>A really amazing game engine. Unreal Engine is already free for developers, so there shouldn’t be much of a surprise that it is on this list. It can be daunting when getting started. But not because of the lack of resources, but because of the amount of tools and skills required.</p>

<h3>Products that I am still uncertain of:</h3>

<ul>
<li>dnsimple</li>
<li>Orchestrate</li>
<li>Bitnami</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this brief explanation of each product has helped you. If there is anything that I have learned in this process is that tech services’ websites do a terrible job explaining <strong>WHAT</strong> they do and <strong>WHY</strong> you need them. For me, the most obscure ones were dnsimple, Travis CL, Orchestrate, CrowdFlower, and Bitnami. My main goal is to be able to use all of these technologies and report on this blog examples on how to use them to the fullest so I can save other’s time. For some of these tools (AWS, Namecheap, GithubPages) there are plenty resources on how to use them that are easy to access, but for other services/products they are a little bit harder to find.</p>
